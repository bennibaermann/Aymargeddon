In RAGNAROEK.sql, is the export from the testing-database,
generated with the script extract_structure_and_localize

In LOCALIZE.sql the same but only for table LOCALIZE.

The script backup generates a backup in ./+RAGNAROEK_BACKUP.sql

The script from_scratch generates a complete empty database but with
the old PLAYER and LOCALIZE tables.

The script do_sql executes his first command with mysql

in my.cnf is my configuration file for mysql to work with
InnoDB tabletype. make shure InnoDB tabletype works for you. mysql
sets default tabletype to MyISAM if it does not work without
complaining! But FROGS and Aymargeddon wont work without the
transaction-capability from InnoDB
