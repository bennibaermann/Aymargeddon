In RAGNAROEK.sql, is the export from the testing-database,
generated with the script extract_structure_and_localize

In LOCALIZE.sql the same but only for table LOCALIZE.

The script backup generates a backup in ./+RAGNAROEK_BACKUP.sql

The script from_scratch generates a complete empty database but with
the old PLAYER and LOCALIZE tables.

The script init_server deletes PLAYER to and uses LOCALIZE_INIT
instead of LOCALIZE. this should only be uses if you start a new server or
want to get rid of your players. (TODO: does not work properly)

The script do_sql executes his standard input with mysql in the
database RAGNAROEK with the appropriate user and password.

in my.cnf is my configuration file for mysql to work with
InnoDB tabletype. make shure InnoDB tabletype works for you. old
versions of mysql
sets default tabletype to MyISAM if it does not work without
complaining! But FROGS and Aymargeddon wont work without the
transaction-capability from InnoDB. This should not be used for newer
versions of Mysql.
